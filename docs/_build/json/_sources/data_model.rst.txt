Data Model
==========

Our internal data model consists of entities, relations, vocabularies and some meta-classes (e.g. annotations,
revisions etc.)

Entities
--------

The entities build the core of the internal APIS data-model:

* *Person:* Natural persons
* *Place:* Any place on earth that can be defined by longitude and latitude. Mainly cities and countries.
* *Institution:* Any legal entity or legal entity similar entity. This includes obviously organisations, but also
  religions, or long lasting prizes.
* *Event:* Any event that took place in history and is too big to model as a relation. This does not include a birth
  of a person (like it would be modeled in event based data models) as the birth is split up between attributes (e.g.
  the date of birth) and relations to other entities (e.g. the mother). It includes though wars and battles as these
  would need a lot of entities to relate to each other.
* *Work:* Basically anything that human beings produce: letters and books, paintings, buildings and cars.

Relations
---------

Every entity in the APIS data model can be related to any other entity.
