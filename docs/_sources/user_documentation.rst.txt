User documentation
==================

The user documentation is for researchers that use the system in their day to day work. Developers please refer to the
:doc:`internal_api` and :doc:`data_model`, admins please please refer to :doc:`installation` and :doc:`configuration`.

finding entities within APIS
----------------------------

You can search for the forename or the surname of a person. As a result you will get a list with suitable biographies.
Then you can apply different filters like date of birth or gender to narrow your search down. If you are already working
on a predefined collection you can also select a specific filter to get all biographies linked to it. For every type of
entity the view differs a little bit. For instance you can filter the places also through longitude or latitude
coordinates. Within the institutions you can search for the date of foundation. Etc.

building own vocabularies
-------------------------

If you start a new annotation project you will first need to define your vocabularies. It will depend on your particular
research questions and interests. Each vocabulary defines the specific relation between two types of entities
(like person and place, person and person e.g.). For the beginning try to keep it simple and start with a general set
of relations like place of activity, place of study or place of residence. If you get a better understanding of the
biographical narratives in your collection you will be able to build up a more customised vocabulary. There every relation
can be hierarchical structured. That means you can have a relation like was university president of the Universität Wien
which is the subcategory of was employee of Universität Wien.
